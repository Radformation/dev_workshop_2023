Resources
---------

This repo is designed as a artifact of the breakouts which will allow attendees and the community at large to
view content, before, during, and after the event. It is intended to be useful as a reference if and when
developers broach these topics in their clinics. Use the links on the left to navigate through the
breakouts.

Description
-----------

In the ever-evolving field of medical physics, professionals constantly seek to improve the accuracy, efficiency, and quality of diagnoses, development and treatment of RT plans. This repo is a brief guidebook that delves into six vital subjects, presenting a view of essential technologies in medical imaging. Whether you are an aspiring developer, a seasoned software engineer, or a medical physicist seeking to enhance your understanding of the underlying technologies, this event and repo is designed to introduce you to the knowledge and skills needed to excel in this exciting domain.

Session 1, Breakout 1: ESAPI
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

This breakout begins with an exploration of ESAPI (Eclipse Scripting Application Programming Interface),
a powerful scripting interface used in the renowned Eclipse treatment planning system.
We will provide a detailed overview of ESAPI's capabilities, guiding readers through the creation of custom scripts for automating tasks,
improving workflow efficiency, and enhancing treatment plan quality.

Session 1, Breakout 2: Image Contouring Techniques
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Accurate delineation of anatomical structures is vital for treatment planning and
precise radiation delivery. This chapter delves into image contouring techniques,
exploring methods for extracting and segmenting regions of interest from medical images.
From manual delineation to semi-automated and fully automated algorithms,
attendees will gain an understanding of the contouring process and possible solutions
to automated or semi-automated algorithms.

Session 1, Breakout 3: Programming Best Practices
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

In addition to the software patterns (breakout in session 2), this breakout delves into the realm of best programming practices
for developing software in the medical imaging field. From code organization and documentation
to version control and testing methodologies, readers will gain valuable insights into the industry's highest standards and improve the overall quality of their codebase.

Session 2, Breakout 1: Introduction to Software Patterns
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

To develop robust and maintainable software solutions in medical imaging,
understanding software patterns is crucial. This chapter explores common design patterns,
architectural patterns, and best practices specifically tailored for medical imaging applications.
It provides insights into structuring code, optimizing performance, and promoting extensibility and modularity.

Session 2, Breakout 2: Automated Planning in Medical Imaging
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

This breakout focuses on automated planning,
a cutting-edge subfield that combines image analysis, optimization algorithms,
and clinical knowledge to generate treatment plans tailored to individual patients.
We will cover the principles behind automated planning systems,
the integration of patient-specific data, and the challenges and opportunities
associated with this transformative technology.

Session 2, Breakout 3: DICOM
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

DICOM serves as the standard for storing, transmitting, and sharing medical images and
related data. This chapter introduces the fundamental concepts of DICOM,
its underlying structure, and some background.
It also covers practical aspects of working with DICOM images and files.
